            h3 How do I use Defcon One?
            p
              | It's easy! Sign up using the link under the users menu in the corner of this site. Once you have an account, go to "contacts" to add phone numbers and email addresses of people you want to alert. When you need help, click the "alert" link, and click one of the buttons, depending on your situation. The buttons will send the displayed message to the selected people in your Defcon One contacts list. If it's an emergency, use the crisis page instead to alert everyone at once with a more urgent message. If you are having suicidal thoughts, please call a suicide hotline (1-800-273-TALK). If you or someone you know is in immediate danger, call 9-1-1.
